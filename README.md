# General 001 - Configuration Server

Process to generate a configuration server for applications with Spring Cloud Config and Spring Data JDBC.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

* [Maven 3]()
* [Java Development Kit]()

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method
in the `com.github.danielprz1394.general.general_001_configuration_server.General001ConfigurationServerApplication`
class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use
the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html)
like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
